## 1861 Canada Census (family)

The 1861 census shows Thomas Gamelin (GGG grandfather), Israel Gamelin (GG grandfather),  Domithilde Dauplaise (GG grandmother), Israal Gamelin, and Thomas Gamelin (G grandfather)

I think Israel, Domithilde, Israel (Jr) and Thomas may have been in the US at that time, but likely Thomas (sr) stated them as living in his dwelling.
