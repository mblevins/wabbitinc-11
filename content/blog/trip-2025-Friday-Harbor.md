In July 2025, we took a trip to Friday Harbor on San Juan Island. The full picture gallery is [here](https://lmblevins.smugmug.com/Travel/2025-Friday-Harbor)

## Port Townsend

We drove to Port Townsend and had dinner with our friend Sandy, staying a night in the [Biship Hotel](https://www.thebishophotel.com).

## Friday Harbor

We parked the car at the hotel, and took a [whale watching](pugetsoundexpress.com) boat to Friday Harbor to stay for two nights.  They have a full day tour with lunch at Friday Harbor, so we could book two half days (morning and afternoon) to get there and back.

We stayed at the [Earthbox Inn](https://www.earthboxinn.com/) for two nights.

On the boat, some folks told us you could rent little utility vehicles from [Suzi's Mopeds](https://susiesmopeds.com), so on a whim we did. We rented a little electric italian (car? 4 wheel electric moped?) that we used to loop the island.

We learned about the infamous "pig war" that almost resulted in a war, but cooler heads prevailed. Could use some of those cooler heads these days!

We stopped on the other side of the island and had a little picnic.

## Poulsbo

After we got back to Port Townsend on the boat, we drove to Poulsbo, WA to stay overnight. It is supposed to have a nice Norwegian oriented downtown, but we got there late and had an early dinner at a strip mall by the hotel. The non-Norwegian part of Poulsbo seems very much a newer commuting community. 

Drove back home the next day.
